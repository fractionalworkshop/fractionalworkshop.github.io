      "content": "### INdAM workshop on Fractional Differential Equations:Modeling, Discretization, and Numerical Solvers      July 12-14, 2021        Rome & Online  The INdAM workshop \"Fractional Differential Equations:Modeling, Discretization, and Numerical Solvers\" will take place in Rome, July 12-14, 2021 and *partially* online.The **in presence** part of the workshop will take place at Best WesternGlobus Hotel in Viale Ippocrate, 119, 00161, Roma (RM), inside the Ping room.#### The workshopFractional calculus deals with the study and application of integrals andderivatives of non-integer order. These operators, unlike the classic operatorsof integer order,  are non-local operators and are better suited to describephenomena with memory (with respect to time and/or space).Although the basic ideas of fractional calculus go back over three centuries,only in recent decades has there been a rapid increase in interest towardsthis field of research, due not only to the increasing use fractional calculusin applications in *biology*, *physics*, *engineering*, *probability*, etc., but alsothanks to the availability of new and more powerful **numerical tools** that allowsfor an **efficient solution** of problems that until a few years ago appearedunsolvable.In fact, numerical analysis plays a decisive role in fractional calculus.The analytical solution of fractional differential equations (FDEs) appears evenmore difficult than in the integer case and, therefore, practically every type ofapplication of fractional calculus requires adequate numerical tools.This workshop, therefore, aims to bring together the two communities of numericalanalysts operating in this field -- the ones working on methods for the solution ofdifferential problems and the one working on the numerical linear algebra side --to *share knowledge* and *create synergies*.It also intends to encourage meetings with researchers who deal with these problems froma more applicative point of view, both in fields such as mathematical physics and infields with an higher technological content such as image recognition and engineering(especially in the automatic control of systems).The **main topics** of the workshop are:- Numerical methods for differential problems of fractional order- Solving systems of large linear equations with dense matrices and use of preconditioners- Fractional Laplacian- Image processing using fractional operators- Application in physics of fractional operators- Machine learning techniques in the fractional environment",
