  title: Numerical methods for spectral fractional diffusion

    We present three schemes for the numerical approximation of the spectral
    fractional Laplacian. The first method uses a rational approximation to
    approximate negative fractional powers of an operator. The second is a
    discretization of the so-called Balakrishnan formula, which expresses
    fractional powers of a positive operator. The third, is a PDE approach that
    exploits the extension to one higher dimension. We discuss pros and cons of
    each method, and error estimates. Time permitting, we extend some of these
    to more general problems, both steady, time dependent; linear, and nonlinear.
    We show illustrative simulations, applications, and mention challenging
    open questions.
